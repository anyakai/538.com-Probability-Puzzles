 
# The misanthropes are coming. 
# Suppose there is a row of some number, N, of houses in a new, initially empty development. 
# Misanthropes are moving into the development one at a time and selecting a house at random from those that have nobody in them and nobody living next door. 
# They keep on coming until no acceptable houses remain. 
# At most, one out of two houses will be occupied; at least one out of three houses will be. 

#But whatâ€™s the expected fraction of occupied houses as the development gets larger, that is, as N goes to infinity?

#create a matrix that simulates the conditions of the misanthrope problem. 
misanthrope <- function(N){
  house <- as.data.frame(matrix(0,2*N,N)) #make the matrix twice as long as wide so that we are sure that there are no gaps left where a misanthrope can move in

  house[1,a] <- 1 #first misanthrope moves in

    } else if (a==N & house[i+1,(N-1)] == 0) {house[i+1,N] <- 1 #if there are no neighbors, the misanthrope moves in
    } else if (a==N & house[i+1,(N-1)] == 1) {house[i+1,N] <- 0
    } else if (house[i+1,a+1] == 1 | house[i+1,a-1] == 1) {house[i+1,a] <- 0 
    } else {house[i+1,a] <- 1}
  }

#post script - the correct answer is 0.432 -> increase the number of simulations + replications
