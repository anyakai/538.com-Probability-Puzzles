#A video game requires you to slay monsters to collect gems. 
#Every time you slay a monster, it drops one of three types of gems: 
  #a common gem, an uncommon gem or a rare gem. 

#The probabilities of these gems being dropped are in the ratio of 3:2:1 
# â€” three common gems for every two uncommon gems 
#for every one rare gem, on average. If you slay monsters until you have at least one of each of the three types of gems, 
#how many of the most common gems will you end up with, on average?

#keep dropping gems until you have all, count how many common
